# joblist-app
It's a simple React App thats adds a _name_ and a _job_
person to a table list. Builded following [this great Getting Started
tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/) by [Tania
Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia).

## Considerations
I took advantage of the tutorial for a brief comparative study about the 
concepts of use **Functional Components** and **Class Components**
implementations and the uso of *React Hooks* over lifecycle methods.
